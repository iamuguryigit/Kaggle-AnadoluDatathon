# Kaggle-AnadoluDatathon

This is the code that I prepared for the competition held by an insurance company named as Anadolu Sigorta on Kaggle. 

I completed the datathon at 3rd place out of 114 teams. The competition was about the prediction of whether a client will increase his/her regular payments about the retirement plan in next year above the inflation rate of current year.
